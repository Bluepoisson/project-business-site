# Business Site

Create a business site with a sign up form to be submitted/posted. The site should also contain a text accordion.

## The problem

Hesitating over the theme the site should have I started building it quite late in the process. However, I knew from the beginning I wanted a hero-video. The video then decided what sort of site I would build.
Something minimalistic in contrast to the video.

What I struggle with (in this moment) are 3 things:

1 - spending more time in Css finding ways to tweek the design than actually needed.
2 - establishing flex relationships
3 - responsiveness

This time I decided to spend more time on the "structutal" aspects of the html and css than previously. Rewarding myself with css fun.

Techniques used: transform/transition and animated text-fill in css. Javascript.
